# WhatToGrow
Project for the course CSE3105 (Machine Learning). 
WhatToGrow is An ML model that will give you the properties of the soil and recommend what to grow based on an image of the soil. If you are a new farmer looking for advice or looking to buy farming land and want to know what the value of the land is you are looking at, you can use WhatToGrow to click a picture of the soil and know what it is, what are its properties and what to grow in that soil in what season.  
We have used RPA to create the dataset of soil images. The model used is a Convolution Neural Network (CNN). It is one of the best models for image classification. The model will analyze the image and tell you the highest percentage soils present in the image, The moisture, minerals, pH, organic matter, regions you may find this type of soil and most importantly, the crops you can grow in it.
